INTRODUCTION


My daughter began her adventures in counting with her own unique style, "1, 3, 6, 9", pulling out a rice grain, a macaroni noodle, or a blueberry with each count. ICount is a simple template for a health log that you can make as unique as your child (or yourself). My wife and I developed it because our daughter has a severe form of epilepsy, requiring us to maintain logs of her seizures, medications, and observations on her condition before, during, and after seizures. Initially we looked to some of the pre set forms used for epilepsy, then upon finding them inflexible, switched to detail notes based on the clinical practice of Pediatric Occupational Therapists. As the need to sort out this information to in erase our own understanding of medications, seizures, indications of incipient seizure conditions we've taken to developing a coded form that takes allows one to take flexible notes, but also supports analysis of the data.
